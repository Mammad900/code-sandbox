# Code sandbox

This is an HTML code sandbox app.

## Features

- Uses Monaco editor, the editor which powers VSCode.
- Has auto-update functionality
- Is responsive
- Works offline
- Modern UI and smooth animations
- Is open-source and does not have ADs or paid features

## How to use

1. Open the app. Link is in the description.
2. Edit the HTML on the left
3. Click 'Run' at the top left
4. HTML renders on the right

### Auto-update

When auto-update is enabled, the HTML renders automatically when you type. This is useful for small files, but not ideal for large files.

You can enable auto-update by enabling the check-box near the 'Run' button.

When you disable auto-update, the rendered HTML reverts back to the last time 'Run' was clicked.

## Still missing features

- Saving & Loading codes (files and browser storage)
- Multi-file
- Editing Monaco-editor UI to suit the other parts of the app
- Customization
